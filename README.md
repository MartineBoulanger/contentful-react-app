# React and Contentful Practice App

This is my practice app for practicing React with Contentful.
I made this app with hooks and function components.

In this app the following packages are used:

* Bootstrap 5 => with cdn (see index.html)
* Font Awesome => with cdn (see index.html)
* Marked => yarn add marked or npm install marked
* Contentful => yarn add contentful or npm install contentful
* Apollo Client => yarn add @apollo/client or npm install @apollo/client
* Graphql => yarn add graphql or npm install graphql

# I can't see the content!?
You need to make your own contentful account and space with the content types and entries, 
make a .env file in the root folder and add there the credentials in variables, then change the variable names (if you named them differently) in the client.js, 
change the code there where needed, like the entry ids or the names of the content types and of course the names of the fields.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
